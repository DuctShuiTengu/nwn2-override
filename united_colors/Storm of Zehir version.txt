== United Colors: Storm of Zehir compatible version ==

This is the SoZ compatible version of United Colors. Note that I have not created United Colors; I simply modified the existing version of it to support SoZ. It was no more than editing one single entry and copy-pasting a few lines, so all credit goes to the original author, gaoneng.

Oh, and if by any chance gaoneng feels insulted and requires me to delete this, I will, since I have not gained his permission to edit his work. Unless that happens, enjoy!
